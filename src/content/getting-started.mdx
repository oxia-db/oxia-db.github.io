# Getting Started

<Steps>
    ### Obtaining Oxia

    <Tabs items={['Docker', 'Build from Source']}>
        <Tabs.Tab>
            Oxia is available in form of a Docker image: `oxia/oxia:latest`
        </Tabs.Tab>
        <Tabs.Tab>
            ```shell
            make
            ```
            This will create the binary file on `bin/oxia`.
        </Tabs.Tab>
    </Tabs>

    ### Standalone

    Oxia standalone is a single-node single-process instance of Oxia that can started with little or no configuration.
    It provides a full-fledged Oxia service with a `default` namespace. Being a single-node instance, the data is not
    getting replicated.

    ```shell
    oxia standalone
    ```

    Output will be something like:

    ```
    Mar 30 16:51:40.519927 INF Starting Oxia standalone
    config={"DataDir":"./data/db","InMemory":false,"InternalServiceAddr":"","MetricsServiceAddr":"0.0.0.0:8080","NotificationsRetentionTime":3600000000000,"NumShards":1,"PublicServiceAddr":"0.0.0.0:6648","WalDir":"./data/wal","WalRetentionTime":3600000000000}

    Mar 30 16:51:40.566760 INF Serving Prometheus metrics at http://localhost:8080/metrics
    ```

    The service is now ready at `localhost:6648` address.

    Using docker this can be done with:

    ```shell
    docker run -p 6648:6648 streamnative/oxia:latest oxia standalone
    ```

    ### Interacting with Oxia

    There is a convenient CLI tool that allows you to interact with the records stored in Oxia.

    ```shell
    # Write or update a record
    $ oxia client put my-key my-value
    {"key":"my-key","version_id":2132,"created_timestamp":"2025-06-17T17:09:26.043-07:00","modified_timestamp":"2025-06-17T17:09:26.043-07:00","modifications_count":0,"ephemeral":false,"session_id":0,"client_identity":""}


    # Read the value of a key
    $ oxia client get my-key
    my-value

    # Read value with version information
    $ oxia client get my-key -v
    my-value
    ---
    {"key":"my-key","version_id":2132,"created_timestamp":"2025-06-17T17:09:26.043-07:00","modified_timestamp":"2025-06-17T17:09:26.043-07:00","modifications_count":0,"ephemeral":false,"session_id":0,"client_identity":""}
    ```

    ### Using client SDKs

    Oxia has several client SDKs that can be used:

     1. [Java SDK](/docs/clients/java)
     1. [Go SDK](/docs/clients/go)
     1. [Python SDK](/docs/clients/python)
