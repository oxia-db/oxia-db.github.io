Oxia is positioned as a modern, horizontally scalable metadata store and coordination system designed to address the
limitations inherent in traditional systems within large-scale distributed environments.

It is engineered to serve as a core infrastructure component, particularly for high-performance data streaming platforms.



## Why Oxia?

Oxia directly confronts the central challenge of balancing scalability, latency, and cost efficiency within contemporary
data streaming infrastructures. Many organizations frequently encounter a dilemma, compelled to choose between scaling
their data operations to meet demand and maintaining manageable costs.

Oxia is specifically designed to alleviate issues observed in existing coordination systems such as Apache ZooKeeper, Etcd, and Consul.

It achieves this through a set of key features, including:

- [Sharding Based Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture))
- [Standard Key-Value API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database)
- Full Features as Metadata Store
- High W/R Performance Based on the [LSM-Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree)
- Policy-Based Shard Placement
- Automatic Operation and Disaster Recovery
- Modern Observability based on the [Open-Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)
