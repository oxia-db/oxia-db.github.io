# Ephemeral records

Oxia records can be optionally marked as *ephemerals*.

Ephemeral records have their lifecycle tied to a particular client instance, and they
are automatically deleted when the client instance is closed.
These records are also deleted if the client cannot communicate with the Oxia
service for some extended amount of time, and the session between the client and
the service "expires".

Application can control the session behavior by setting the session timeout
appropriately with [WithSessionTimeout] option when creating the client instance.

Oxia can partition the data in different namespaces. Application can use namespaces to isolate different use cases
and also have more visibility in the metrics, which are going to be labeled with the namespace as well.

Each namespace has its own independent key-space and set of shards.

## Use cases

Ephemeral records can be used to implement many system coordination tasks, such as:

 1. Service discovery
 2. Leader election
 3. Distributed resource locks

## Using ephemeral records

When creating/modifying a record, applications can specify the "ephemeral" option:

<Tabs items={['Go', 'Java']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```go
        insertedKey, res, err := client.Put(context.Background(),
                                    "my-key", []byte("my-value"),
                                    oxia.Ephemeral())
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```java
        PutResult pr = client.put("my-key", "my-value".getBytes(),
                                    Set.of(PutOption.AsEphemeralRecord));
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>


## Oxia session management

An ephemeral record is tied to a particular session. Oxia client SDK will automatically
create a session the first time there is an attempt to write ephemeral records.

The session is internally managed by the client SDK, which will also take care of the
heartbeat communications with the server.

A session is deleted when:

 1. Client instance is gracefully closed, deleting the session
 2. Client crashed, causing the Oxia server to expire the session
 3. Client is partitioned from Oxia, causing the Oxia server to expire the session

When a session is deleted or expired, all the ephemeral records tied to that session
are automatically deleted.

If a client is subscribed to the notifications, it will receive the corresponding events.

In case of network partitioning, the client SDK is internally proceeding to create a
new session.

### Session ID and client identity

A client can optionally specify a client identifier that will be tied to the session.

<Tabs items={['Go', 'Java']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```go
        client, err := oxia.NewClient("localhost:6648", oxia.WithIdentity("my-client-identity"))
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```java
        SyncOxiaClient client = OxiaClientBuilder.create("localhost:6648")
                                    .clientIdentifier("my-client-identifier")
                                    .syncClient();
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

The client identity is stored as part of the version object, for ephemeral records, and will
allow applications to detect ephemeral records that were written by the same logical client
instance before a crash.

```json
{
  "key": "my-key",
  "version_id": 2145,
  "created_timestamp": "2025-06-22T10:21:00.107-07:00",
  "modified_timestamp": "2025-06-22T10:21:00.107-07:00",
  "modifications_count": 0,
  "ephemeral": true,
  "session_id": 1677,
  "client_identity": "my-client-identity"
}
```
