# Notifications

Oxia allows applications to get a feed of all the changes happening in a given namespace. This is
similar to a database change-data-capture (CDC).

Once a notification object is created, a client is guaranteed to receive notification of
all the changes happening in Oxia after that point, even in the presence of an arbitrary number
of failures.

## Subscribing to notifications

 <Tabs items={['Go', 'Java', 'CLI']}>
        <Tabs.Tab>
            ```go
            notifications, err := client.GetNotifications()
            defer notifications.Close()

            for notification := range notifications.Ch() {
                fmt.Println(notification)
            }
            ```
        </Tabs.Tab>
        <Tabs.Tab>
            ```java
            client.notifications(notification -> {
                System.out.println("Got notification: " + notification);
            });
            ```
        </Tabs.Tab>
        <Tabs.Tab>
            ```shell
            oxia client notifications
            ```
        </Tabs.Tab>
    </Tabs>

### Notification event types

| Name                   | Description                            |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `KeyCreated`           | A record that didn't exist was created |
| `KeyModified`          | An existing record was modified        |
| `KeyDeleted`           | A record was deleted                   |
| `KeyRangeRangeDeleted` | A range of keys was deleted            |

Notification event fields:

| Name          | Type               | Description                                                                                                  |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Type`        | `NotificationType` | The type of the modification                                                                                 |
| `Key`	        | `string`           | The Key of the record to which the notification is referring                                                 |
| `VersionId`   | `int64`            | The current VersionId of the record, or -1 for a KeyDeleted event                                            |
| `KeyRangeEnd` | `string`           | In case of a KeyRangeRangeDeleted notification, this would represent the end (excluded) of the range of keys |

## Disabling notifications

Notifications are enabled by default on namespaces. Since there is some overhead for preparing the notifications
feed, if an application doesn't need this feature it can be disabled.

In the coordinator `config.yaml`, set `notificationsEnabled=false` on the specific namespace configuration.
