# Python Client SDK


## Installing Python client SDK

```shell
pip install oxia
```

PyDoc documentation is available at https://oxia-db.github.io/oxia-client-python/latest

## Client API

### Initializing the client

To use the Oxia client, you need to create a client instance. Once created, a client instance will be valid until
it's explicitly closed, and it can be used from different threads.

```python
import oxia
client = oxia.Client("localhost:6648")
```

When creating the client is possible to pass several options, such as:

```python
client = oxia.Client("localhost:6648",
                     namespace="my-namespace",
                     client_identifier="my-client-identity",
)
```

For the full list of options, see the [Client constructor docs](https://oxia-db.github.io/oxia-client-python/latest/oxia.Client.html#__init__).

### Writing records


```python

# Write a record to Oxia with the specified key and value, and with the expectation
# that the record does not already exist.
key, version1 = client.put("my-key", "value-1",
                           expected_version_id=oxia.EXPECTED_RECORD_DOES_NOT_EXIST)


# Write a record with the expectation that it has not changed since the previous write.
# If there was any change, the operation will fail
key, version2 = client.put("my-key", "value-2",
                           expected_version_id=version1.version_id())
```

All the options for the put operation are available in the
[put() method docs](https://oxia-db.github.io/oxia-client-python/latest/oxia.Client.html#put).

### Reading records

Reading the value of a record

```go
key, value, version = client.get("my-key")
```
All the options for the get operation are available in the
[get() method docs](https://oxia-db.github.io/oxia-client-python/latest/oxia.Client.html#get).
